# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Every code change goes through the quality gate (tests, lint, review) before it can be committed — enforced by tooling, not by prompting.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Package Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Package Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Context gathered, ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Phase 1 context gathered

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Extract to standalone package (not template) — Templates can't be installed into existing projects, can't be updated cleanly
- MCP-only interface (no CLI) — All interaction through coding agents; single entry point simplifies distribution
- Worktree default ~/.vibraphone/worktrees/ — Global location outside project dir reduces agent confusion
- Project-level config only (vibraphone.yaml) — Simplicity for v1; user-level defaults deferred
- Detect-and-guide for br/bv — Bundling Rust binaries adds complexity; check_prerequisites tells users how to install
- Governance files in .planning/vibraphone/ — Keeps vibraphone scaffolding separate from GSD planning docs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 1**: ~~FastMCP entry point pattern needs verification~~ — Resolved: use FastMCP docs pattern
- **Phase 3**: Session recovery has known bug — may need debugging during migration
- **Phase 7**: init_project file merging strategy needs careful design to avoid overwriting user files
