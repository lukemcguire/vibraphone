# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Every code change goes through the quality gate (tests, lint, review) before it can be committed — enforced by tooling, not by prompting.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Package Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Package Foundation) - COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 complete - Package foundation with tests verified
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 01-03 test suite and verification

Progress: [█████████░░░] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 2.7 min
- Total execution time: 0.13 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-package-foundation | 3 | 3 | 2.7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 2.7 min
- Trend: Starting

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Extract to standalone package (not template) — Templates can't be installed into existing projects, can't be updated cleanly
- MCP-only interface (no CLI) — All interaction through coding agents; single entry point simplifies distribution
- Worktree default ~/.vibraphone/worktrees/ — Global location outside project dir reduces agent confusion
- Project-level config only (vibraphone.yaml) — Simplicity for v1; user-level defaults deferred
- Detect-and-guide for br/bv — Bundling Rust binaries adds complexity; check_prerequisites tells users how to install
- Governance files in .planning/vibraphone/ — Keeps vibraphone scaffolding separate from GSD planning docs
- Use Hatchling auto-discovery for src layout (01-01) — No explicit wheel config needed for src layout
- Use importlib mode for pytest (01-01) — Works with src layout without flat pythonpath
- FastMCP tools are FunctionTool objects (01-02) — Verify via mcp._tool_manager, not direct call
- Entry point via uv pip install -e . (01-02) — Available at .venv/bin/vibraphone, not global PATH
- Subprocess test pattern for entry point (01-03) — Verifies module runnable without blocking on stdin
- Config cache clearing in test setup (01-03) — Ensures test isolation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 1**: ~~FastMCP entry point pattern needs verification~~ — Resolved: use FastMCP docs pattern
- **Phase 3**: Session recovery has known bug — may need debugging during migration
- **Phase 7**: init_project file merging strategy needs careful design to avoid overwriting user files

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-16 — Completed Phase 1 Package Foundation
